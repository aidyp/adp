I am sometimes asked by friends, "what is the cloud?". As I start to ramble on about the answer, I can see their eyes glaze over. Hopefully, with this blog, I can explain "the cloud" clearly.

If you ask a computer person, "what is the cloud?", you are more than likely to receive the following firm and confident answer.

> The cloud is just sombody else's computer

> -- some computer person

This is true, but unhelpful. We've had computers for ages, but this cloud thing is pretty recent. If the cloud is just someone else's computer, how come the cloud hasn't been around longer? I have a computer, does that mean I can run a cloud from my laptop? 

The best way to understand cloud computing is to understand the motivation behind it. It should take about ten minutes.



### Computers are expensive

This is the driving factor behind cloud computing. When I say, "computer", I don't mean your laptop. I mean something like this,

### share the work

Because computers are expensive, it's not feasible to buy a new computer for each use. Let's take an example. Suppose you are a university and you want to buy a powerful computer so that your professors can do some research. 

The following problem presents itself.





### virtualisation
