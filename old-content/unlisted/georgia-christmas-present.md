## The Prequel

The tour begins at the scenic Free Trade Wharf[^2] building in East London. A hearty breakfast of pastries and coffee* is provided free of charge. 

We'll have to start early to get to all the bookshops in time for tea, so I can either meet you at Wapping station with breakfast-to-go, or you can stay over the night before.

[^2]: May age poorly.

**Oat milk is available on request*

From the river, we're off to Shoreditch via train for the first chapter in our adventure.

## The Game Is Afoot!

### Libreria

![Alt](/pictures/georgia/libreria-books.jpg#center)

> I have squandered and consumed my years in adventures of this type. To me, it does not seem unlikely that on some shelf of the universe there lies a total book. -- **Jorge Luis Borges**

Libreria is a bookshop in Shoreditch, founded in 2016. It was founded by a guy who used to be a Downing Street policymaker who realised his -- and all of our -- dream to open a bookshop in a trendy part of London.

It's influenced, according to the founder, on *Library of Babel*, a short book that explores an imaginary library that contains all possible permutations of books that have exactly 410 pages. The librarians in the book find it awfully difficult to manage all of these books as so many of them are a nonsensical collection of letters. Libreria's founder believes that we, stuck in the information age, suffer from the same problem. 

Libreria is not organised like a regular bookshop; there are no traditional categories like fiction, history, cooking, etc. Instead, books are organised into suggestive themes. We'll spend some time browsing these themes, and discussing the irony of a Downing Street policymaker creating a temple dedicated to giving people the information they really need. 

Then, with Libreria behind us, it's on to Granary Square in Kings Cross!



### Word On The Water

![Alt](/pictures/georgia/word-on-the-water.jpg#center)

> Twenty years from now, you will be more disappointed by the things you didn't do than those you did. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from safe harbour. Catch the wind in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover -- **Mark Twain**

Moored on the north side of Regent's Canal, just a stone's throw away from platform 9 and 3/4s, is her majesty's book barge *Word On The Water*. I used to live in Camden, a few kilometres up the canal. I would often walk down to Granary Square in the summer when I was bored in order to board the bookshop. The barge itself is 100 years old. They also have a dog!

Once we've returned to dry land, it's off to Caledonian Road



### Persephone / Housmans

![Alt](/pictures/georgia/persephone-books.jpg#center)

> The only advice, indeed, that one person can give another about reading is to take no advice, to follow your own instincts, to use your own reason, to come to your own conclusions -- **Virginia Woolf**

If women must have a room of their own to write fiction, then there ought to be a shop of their own in which to sell it. Persephone is that bookshop.  Sadly, due to the pandemic, Persephone had to move to Bath.  We don't have time to go to Bath and back during the tour, but this gift voucher comes with a proposed follow-up city break, of which Persephone will be a part.



![Alt](/pictures/georgia/housmans-books.jpg#center)

In keeping with the spirit of this bookshop, we'll instead go to Housmans, a radical bookseller based in Caledonian Road. Down with the man, although hopefully not _all_ of them!

Once we've had our fill of anarchy, it's off to Bloomsbury; where I studied for four years and still never learned how to use a semi-colon.



### London Review Bookshop

![Alt](/pictures/georgia/london-review-books.jpg#center)

> Oh, I love London Society! It is entirely composed now of beautiful idiots and brilliant lunatics. Just what society should be -- **Oscar Wilde**

The *London Review Bookshop* is the bookshop of the renowned literary magazine, *London Review of Books*. Described, in their own words, as the pre-eminent exponent of the intellectual essay, the shop boasts that it has 20,000 titles to choose from. I personally think that this blog can meet the challenge of being the greatest exponent for the intellectual essay, but that's a debate for another time.

In addition to their eclectic collection of books, this bookshop also has a lovely little cafe where we can stop for tea and a sandwich. After lunch, and perhaps a few books heavier, we'll head to Covent Garden.



### Goldsboro 

![Alt](/pictures/georgia/goldsboro-books.jpg#center)

> A quotation is a handy thing to have about, saving one the trouble of thinking for oneself, always a laborious business -- **A.A. Milne**

*Goldsboro* is a fancy bookshop. They specialise in signed, first edition hardback books. Situated in the heart of Covent Garden, nothing feels quite so literary as browsing their collection of rare, signed books. Perhaps we can pick up a signed copy from your favourite author, or just wonder what Graham Greene's handwriting looks like.

Covent Garden is also home to street performers and, more importantly, some delightful cocktail bars. 

After drinking in some culture, we're off to Soho.



### Gosh!

![Alt](/pictures/georgia/gosh-books.jpg#center)

> In London, everyone is different, and that means anyone can fit in -- **Paddington Bear**

*Gosh!* is London's best stop for graphic novels. They've been manning the fort for 34 years now, and they have everything. 

I've not got much to write for this one, other than the store is appropriately named. It's what you'll say when you see the size of their collection!

If we manage to pull ourselves from the pages of their comics, we're off to one more stop in Soho before our final bookshop of the day.



### Secret

![Alt](/pictures/georgia/secret-book.jpg#center)

> It's not true that I had nothing on. I had the radio on -- **Marilyn Monroe**

This one's a secret, because I have to leave something to the imagination.

After the reveal, we're off to Marylebone for the final stop.



### Daunt

![Alt](/pictures/georgia/daunt_books.jpg#center)

> It is good to have an end to journey towards; but it is the journey that matters, in the end -- **Ursula Le Guin**

*Daunt Books*, in Marylebone, is beautiful. The bookshop specialises in travel, which makes it the perfect final stop in our bookshop adventure. It was built in 1912, and lays claim to be the first custom-built bookshop in the world. It is now owned by Waterstones, and the brand has several branches in other parts of London, but the Marylebone outlet is the first. 

The shop itself is carved from an old Edwardian building, with long galleries either side of the main hallway. As you walk in to the store, there is a safe that once held their most prized volumes. If *Libreria* is how a bookshop begins, *Daunt Books* is surely how one ends.

## The Evening

![Alt](/pictures/georgia/cosy-picture.jpg#center)

There are a variety of wonderful bars and restaurants in the area. Liaise with your tour guide as to where you want to eat. Then either we can go dancing, or if our feet are sore, simply head back to cosy East London for dinner and a movie.

Merry Christmas, Georgia. See you soon!
