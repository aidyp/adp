## military grade secret keeping

This is a popular misnomer. I see it a lot on adverts for VPNs. It's true that **AES** (**A**dvanced **E**ncryption **S**tandard) is the go-to encryption algorithm for the US military. It's also the go-to algorithm for the rest of the world. _Everyone_ uses AES. Because it works.

## History

AES came about because the previous standard, **DES** (**D**ata **E**ncryption **S**tandard) wasn't up to par. Also, everyone was pretty sure the NSA had messed with it.
