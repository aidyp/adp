I'm writing a lot here to see exactly how long it is before Hugo decide to render the summary. I also want to control the summary so it would be nice to figure that out

I wonder which MD components have automatic mapping

Clearly the summary strips all the content. So it would be nice
to render the summary as a specific note

I'm writing a blog because this is the kind of blog I would like to have read when I was younger.
