## to boldly go where many have gone before

Diagrams of the internet usually look like this,

{need a better segue here}. This blog post is an exploration into the wiring of the internet. When we move information across the internet, what path does it take?

### ICMP Discovery
To explore the vast reaches of cyberspace, we're going to need an appropriate vessel. This section of the blog post will be about the packet used in `traceroute`. I want to inject some humour into it

### traceroute
This subsection explains traceroute, and the Time To Live field, and what happens when it expires. 



### houston, we need a visual
This subsection talks about how to view the the output of the traceroute command, and an explanation of the code written to explore the traceroute. (It is a project to write the code!)

Gotta install jupyter notebook to work with the particular visualisation tool I have -- that is on the To Do list!

## Warp speed

This section is the actual adventuring of the packet, alongside what we discover. Will include some pictures of the *physical* parts of the path, like the green boxes, alongside some of the other stuff.

## Where is stuff

Joe mentioned a really good point about AWS. Now that there are so many things based on the cloud, there is a clustering of all the services. I don't have any comment about whether or not this is a good or a bad thing, I just think it's interesting
