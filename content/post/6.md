On 22 September the government announced that the rule of 6 would apply for 6 months. This post has some unrelated and mildly interesting facts to do with the number 6.

###  6 is the perfect number

6 is a perfect number. That is, it is the product of its factors.
$$
1 + 2 + 3 = 6 
$$
6 is the most perfect of all the perfect numbers. It's the only number that is the sum _and_ the product of 3 successive integers. Other perfect numbers, like 28, can't hope to match this claim to fame.

### 6 is the collaborative number

In the development of the video game, [Overwatch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overwatch_(video_game)), the designers tested to see what team size would be best. Numbers less than 6 didn't work out, as it meant one bad player could ruin the game. Numbers more than 6 didn't suit either, because it felt like each individual player didn't have a significant role in the outcome of the game.

### 6 is the winning number

In 1998, Michael Jordan, who is 6ft 6, in the 6th game of the NBA finals, where he was awarded his 6th finals MVP, won his 6th NBA title. This was not, unfortunately, the game where he was sick.

### 6 is the kissing number

No, not like that. Although covid has [not been kind to dating](https://yougov.co.uk/topics/relationships/articles-reports/2020/06/12/sex-and-dating-under-covid-19). Here the kissing number refers to the largest number of coins of the same size you can fit around a central coin (also the same size) and have them them still touching. It turns out the answer is 6.

Don't believe me? You can prove it for yourself.

### 6 is the connection number

Suppose you kissed someone, and they kissed someone else, and then that person kissed someone else, and so on and so forth. How many kisses until your kiss could reach anyone else on the planet? 

Turns out it's [6 again](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_degrees_of_separation).

### 6 is the covid number

Any gathering of more than six people in England is against the rules (unless exempted). If we all follow the rules, then with a little luck in six months we'll be free.
