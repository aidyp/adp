The Social Dilemma (Netflix) has been a huge hit. My personal opinion is that it's a little heavy handed, and that there are better advocates for data privacy that they could have interviewed.

One thing that stood out to me was the treatment of Whatsapp. In the show, it was treated as one of a plethora of applications that Facebook use to gather data. It stood out to some of my friends too. Whatsapp is end-to-end encrypted. How could it ever be a source of data? The principle, as marketed, of end-to-end encryption is that nobody but you and the person you are talking to can read the messages. 

This blog post is about that.

The first thing to explore is end-to-end encryption. What is it?
