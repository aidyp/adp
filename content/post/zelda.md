A friend of mine decided to hold an elimination tournament for the best video game of all time. It got tense at times. 

It was mostly nostalgia that got us going. Midway through the tournament I decided to make a console that played all those old games. An altar to nostalgia. This blog post is about that.

Oh, and Pokemon Blue won the tournament.



// Idea -- use screenshots from games to structure the post!

A computer, in its basic form, is made up of two parts: hardware and software. The hardware is the group of electronic components that perform different operations. Software is the list of instructions to co-ordinate all those operations into something useful.

The above diagram isn't quite accurate though. Not every computer is the same. Computers are designed with different hardware to solve different problems. Newer computers have different (and better) hardware than older computers.

This poses a problem. What if you want to take some software from `computer 1` and run it on `computer 2`? It won't work -- the software has been designed for a specific hardware configuration. 

- raspberry pi (hardware specs in comparison!)
- retropie (look how well supported this is!)
- experience of playing old games

I needed to pick an appropriate computer. Something small, cheap and portable.





## retropie

Emulation is a popular field. Many programmers played _a lot_ of games as a kid. There's an ongoing project to assemble as many emulators as possible into one engine. It's called [RetroPie](https://retropie.org.uk/).
