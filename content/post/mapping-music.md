## mapping music

During lockdown, like you, I've listened to a lot of music. I've listened to so much music that I've found myself thinking about how to think about the way I listen to music.

### discord

Some friends and I play games online a few (_many_) hours a week, and we talk to each other over Discord Discord is pretty neat, it's open source so people can add modules to it. One of these modules is a music bot. You can type in the name of a song and it will play it in the voice channel for everyone to listen to. 

This leads to a neat group aux session, where we will all queue up songs one after another.

### oh man you're gonna love this next track 



###  spotify

The people who make Spotify are great. They've created an API (**A**pplication **P**rogramming **I**nterface) so that professionals and amateurs alike can write code to extend on their product.

Spotify has three features that I wanted to use. First, it has so many songs (50 million!). Second, it has an almost effortless search. Third, Spotify gives each song a unique identifier. That means once I've found a song through its search function, I only have to store the unique identifier.
