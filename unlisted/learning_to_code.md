My brother (thankfully not a regular reader of this blog) came to me last year and asked me to help him learn to code. Since then, he's secured a place at a top UK university to study a master's degree in computer science. This post is about the lessons we learned. If you'd like to learn to code, but you're not sure where to get started, this might be for you!

### information overload

There is _so_ much material online about how to code. It's overwhelming. Should you follow youtube tutorials? What about a coding bootcamp? 

My advice, whatever you choose to do, is to start small.

### Play(?)

I guess the first thing is to learn what `if` does, `while`, etc, etc. Loops and the like. These are the building blocks of programming. You need to know what all the blocks are before you can put them together

### Solving Puzzles

Once you have an idea of what all the basic building blocks are, you'll want to put them together. This, I think, is the test to see if you'll like programming. The draw of coding is the rush you get when you solve a problem. 

### Pick a project


### Phone a friend

Almost every programmer I know would love to help someone learn to code.
