A friend of mine decided to hold an elimination tournament for the best video game of all time. It got tense at times. 

It was mostly nostalgia that got us going. Midway through the tournament I decided to make a console that played all game. It's a little like an altar to nostalgia. This blog post is about that.

Oh, and Pokemon Blue won the tournament.

Emulators are computers that pretend to be different computers. 

- raspberry pi (hardware specs in comparison!)
- retropie (look how well supported this is!)
- experience of playing old games

I needed to pick an appropriate computer. Something small, cheap and portable.
